#' @title HD2013SGI
#' @description Example data from `r Biocpkg("HD2013")` package from the 
#' publication
#' citation("HD2013SGI"). It contains measurements from combinatorial gene 
#' knock-outs using siRNA, 
#' followed by imaging of the cells. The resulting images were segmented and 
#' features were extracted using the `r Biocpkg("EBImage")` package. Here, 
#' conditions refer to different gene knock-outs, features to the extracted 
#' image 
#' features and replicates to repeated measurements of the individual 
#' conditions.
